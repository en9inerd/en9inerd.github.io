If you've been using Telegram for a while, you might have noticed that the official Telegram clients lack a simple way to delete all your own messages from a chat or channel with just one click, especially if you don't have admin privileges. Frustrating, right?

That's where TgEraser comes to the rescue. I've implemented an interactive command-line tool that leverages the power of the Telethon library to solve this problem. It's written in Python and available on PyPI, so you can install it with a simple `pip install tgeraser` command. Short usage instructions are available on the GitHub repository and in the PyPI Package description.

Say goodbye to manually deleting messages one by one; with TgEraser, you can regain control over your chat history with just a few simple commands.

Feel free to contribute, suggest improvements, or report any issues on the GitHub repository. Happy messaging! :rocket:
