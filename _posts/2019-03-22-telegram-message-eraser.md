I'm using Telegram messenger for the past few years and official Telegram clients still don't have the ability to delete all of your own messages from chat/channel/dialog by one click without administrator help. So, that's why I implemented interactive command line tool to solve this problem using Telethon library. It understands YAML (by default), JSON, and environment variables to specify credentials.

Perhaps, it will be implemented also as Flask web app in the future to give good usability for users.
