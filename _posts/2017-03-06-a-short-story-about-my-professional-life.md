One person asked me to write short story about "How you fell in love with coding?"

Since I was seven, IT industry was always around me. It was very interesting to understand how one or the other device works. In addition, how CPU and GPU are made. As a result, I am always working with the hardware from ZX Spectrum to the present day. In school, I expressed interest in the Turbo Pascal, Delphi languages and HTML/CSS templates. Since I was fourteen, I worked as a PC assembler. When I was seventeen, I started to get involved in front-end and back-end development (HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and a little PHP). During my sophomore year in university, I became a Technical Specialist that included system administration, maintenance of access control systems, and etc. Then I testing of network equipment (SoC RTL89xxC) based on OpenWrt and Octopus at Angstrem-Telecom. After I got master’s degree in MIET (Moscow Institute of Electronic Technology), I gained knowledge in automating physical design of integrated circuits. During my education, most of the experience was in C, C++, Python and implementation algorithms for standart cell placement, routing, and etc. In addition, the theme of my Master's dissertation was: «Implementation of a standard cell global placement package based on modified algorithm “simulated annealing” on stage topological design». Before I moved to USA, my life and profession were associated with IT-industry.
