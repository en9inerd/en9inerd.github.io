Hello everyone!

I don't have a job and a lot of my experience was related to my strength skills (like  C/C++, Python, Algorithms in VLSI Physical design), I need to gain more experience. And I used other programming languages only during university. Also, I have language barrier (reason of many failures) :disappointed:  
Thus, I have problems with employment in USA.  
Therefore, I decided:

- refresh my knowledge about linear algebra, discrete math and geometry, because I didn’t use them a long time after university graduation;
- reimplement my master's diploma project (SimAn);
- grow my rating on HackerRank;
- finish couple of courses on Сoursera. I will try to follow every step of the Coursera courses. I took following courses at the moment:  
  - [Machine Learning (Stanford University)](https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning)  
Taught by: Andrew Ng (Associate Professor)  
  - [Algorithms, Part I (Princeton University)](https://www.coursera.org/learn/algorithms-part1)  
Taught by: Robert Sedgewick (Professor) and Kevin Wayne (Senior Lecturer)
- write this blog.
