Hello, I'm Vladimir, a Full Stack Engineer with a passion for software development and data processing automation. My expertise lies in JavaScript/TypeScript, Node.js, Python, and C programming. At the moment, I specialize in building and maintaining web applications using frameworks like Angular, NestJS, and Express.js.

<p style="text-align: center;">{% avatar {{ site.github.owner_name }} size=200 %}</p>

In my spare time, I delve into web services integration using tools like Node-RED, engage in bot development for the Telegram platform, and explore other activities related to automation just for fun. When I'm not immersed in the tech world, I enjoy hiking and playing video games, particularly colony simulators like RimWorld and Space Haven.
